Insertion Sort Algorithm

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers called nums, sort the array in non-decreasing order using the insertion sort algorithm and return the sorted array.

A sorted array in non-decreasing order is an array where each element is greater than or equal to all preceding elements in the array.

Example 1:
Input:
  nums = [7, 4, 1, 5, 3]
Output:
  [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
Explanation:
  The array is sorted in non-decreasing order: 1 ≤ 3 ≤ 4 ≤ 5 ≤ 7.
