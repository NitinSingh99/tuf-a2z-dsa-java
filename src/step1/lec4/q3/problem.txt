Problem Statement: Given an integer N, return true if it is a palindrome else return false.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121, 1331, and 4554 are palindromes because they remain the same when their digits are reversed.

Example 1:
Input:N = 4554

Output:Palindrome Number

Explanation: The reverse of 4554 is 4554 and therefore it is palindrome number
