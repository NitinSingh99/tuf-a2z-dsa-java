# DSA Learning Journey 🚀

## About This Repository

This repository documents my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Java. I'm following the comprehensive [A2Z DSA Course](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2) by **Striver (TakeUForward)**.

## 📚 Course Structure

The A2Z DSA Course covers everything from basics to advanced topics:

- **Step 1:** Learn the basics
- **Step 2:** Learn important sorting techniques
- **Step 3:** Solve problems on arrays
- **Step 4:** Binary search
- **Step 5:** Strings
- **Step 6:** Linked lists
- **Step 7:** Recursion
- **Step 8:** Bit manipulation
- **Step 9:** Stack and queues
- **Step 10:** Sliding window & two pointer
- **Step 11:** Heaps
- **Step 12:** Greedy algorithms
- **Step 13:** Binary trees
- **Step 14:** Binary search trees
- **Step 15:** Graphs
- **Step 16:** Dynamic programming
- **Step 17:** Tries
- **Step 18:** Strings (advanced)

## 🎯 Goals

- Master fundamental data structures and algorithms
- Develop problem-solving skills
- Build a strong foundation for technical interviews
- Practice consistent coding habits

Each folder contains:
- Problem statements
- Java solutions

## ⚡ How to Run

Compile a question from the terminal:

```bash
javac -d out src/Lec2_BuildUpLogicalThinking/Question3/Q3.java
java -cp out Lec2_BuildUpLogicalThinking.Question3.Q3
```
## 💻 Language

**Java** - All solutions are implemented in Java to strengthen core programming concepts alongside DSA.

## 📝 Progress Tracking

I'm working through the course systematically and updating this repository regularly with:
- ✅ Solved problems
